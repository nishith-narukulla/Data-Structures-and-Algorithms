# Data Structures & Algorithms

## 5 steps to learn

- [x] Learn at least one Programming Language
- [x] Learn about Complexities
- [ ] Learn Data Structure and Algorithms
- [ ] Practice, practice and practice more
- [ ] Compete and become a pro

## Complexities
- these complexities decides whether the solution is efficient or not

### Time Complexity
- to measure the amount of time required to execute the code
- The time required for executing a code depends on
    - The number of operations performed in the program
    - The speed of the device
    - The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform

- **Big-O Notation (Ο)**
    - Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario
- **Omega Notation (Ω)**
    - Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario
- **Theta Notation (θ)**
    - This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm

### Space complexity
- the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the cod
- basically extra space used by your code
